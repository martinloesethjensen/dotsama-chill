# dotsama-chill

You can access the app [here](https://martinloesethjensen.github.io/dotsama-chill/).

> Please note that it can take a minute or two for it to load all the nominators that can be chilled.

There's a post on [polkassembly for tip proposal](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/tip/0x2e98e3eff4e931943b688e718db8dfb8ba27ce2856ffb4364804a72e16db996b).

## Introduction

At present while the `chillOther` extrinsic is permission less many less technical nominators don't know how to find a chillable nominator and thereafter how to chill them. This application helps simplify the process and reduces reliance on Parity/W3F to issue mass chills when limits are reached.

### App features

- Statistics overview
- List of chillable nominators
- Switching between Polkadot & Kusama
- Chill button to do a transaction with `utility.batch` that has an array of `staking.chillOther`.

### Roadmap

- [x] Statistics overview:
  - [x] Minimum nominator bond
  - [x] Nominators
  - [x] Max nominators
  - [x] Chill threshold
  - [x] Chillable amount
  - [x] Era info
- [ ] Identicon on addresses
- [ ] Success popup
  - [x] Showing hash on succeeded transaction
  - [ ] Link to subscan for extrinsic
- [ ] Error popup when trying to "chill" button and transaction somehow fails
- Loading states:
  - [x] Loading of nominators below threshold
  - [x] Loading of transaction
- [x] Empty state (when no nominators can be chilled)
- [ ] Range slider sorting on amount
- [x] Switching between networks (Polkadot & Kusama)
  - currently there's no threshold on Kusama and the current nominators are way below max nominator count.
- [x] Use elara.patract.io endpoint for Polkadot & Kusama
